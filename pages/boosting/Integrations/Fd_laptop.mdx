## Installation Guide

<Steps>
    ### Step 1: Dependencies Check
    
    Ensure you have the following required resources installed and started before attempting to start `fd_laptop`:

    * **[ox_lib](https://github.com/CommunityOx/ox_lib)** (Required for notifications, menus, and client utilities)
    * **[ox_target](https://github.com/CommunityOx/ox_target)** (Recommended for interacting with laptop props)
    * **Your Chosen Framework:** (ESX Legacy, QBCore, QBOX, or Standalone)

    ### Step 2: Download and Placement

    1.  Download the latest version of `fd_laptop` from the **Github Repository**.
    2.  Extract the compressed file and rename the folder to `fd_laptop`.
    3.  Place the `fd_laptop` folder directly into your server's `resources` directory.

    ### Step 3: Enable Compatibility in our boosting resource
    
    Locate the resource's main configuration file at **`shared/config.lua`**.

    * Change `Config.FDLaptop` to `true` or `false` based on your intended usage.

    ```lua
    -- shared/config.lua
    Config.FDLaptop = true -- Set to true to enable the core laptop functionality
    ```
    
    ### Step 4: Start the Resource

    Add the following line to your server's main configuration file (`server.cfg` or `resources.cfg`) to ensure the script starts correctly:

    ```bash
    ensure fd_laptop
    ```
    
    <Callout type="warn">
        **Ordering is Critical!** Ensure `fd_laptop` is started *after* your framework and after `ox_lib`, but before `evolent_boosting`.
    </Callout>
