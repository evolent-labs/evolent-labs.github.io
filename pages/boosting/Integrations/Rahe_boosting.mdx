# RAHE Boosting Migration

This guide outlines the process for migrating existing player progression data (such as levels, reputation, or stats) from the **RAHE Boosting** system to the new Evolent Boosting database structure.

<Callout type="warn">
    **MIGRATION WARNING:** This is a one-time, potentially irreversible data operation. We highly recommend performing this process only when your server is **offline** or the boosting resource is **stopped**.
</Callout>

<Steps>
    ### Step 1: Execute Migration Command
    
    Start your server and execute the migration command directly in your server console. This command will move all existing RAHE data into the new structure.

    ```bash
    convertrahe
    ```

    ### Step 2: Remove Migration Command

    Once the command has been successfully executed and all data is transferred, you must remove the command functionality to prevent accidental re-runs or unauthorized access.

    Locate the command registration and remove or comment out line 171 in:
    **`server/bridge/_main.lua`**

    ### Step 3: Make Level Adjustments

    Since the new system may use different formulas for progression, configure the core Elo/Reputation variables in your main configuration file to properly balance the imported player data.

    Configure the following settings in **`config.lua`** to match your desired progression curve:

    * `Config.BaseElo`
    * `Config.EloModifier`
