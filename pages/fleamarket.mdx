We created a next flea market script that puts control, variety, and player interaction front and center. Whether you’re a casual trader, a collector, or just looking to make some quick cash, our system has something for you. From rare finds to everyday goods, it’s all about making the market feel alive.

## Installation

<Steps>
    ### Step 1: Install Dependencies
    * Ensure you have the following **required resources** installed:
        * Any of the inventory scripts defined in [Configuration](/fleamarket/Config)
        * [ox_lib](https://github.com/CommunityOx/ox_lib)
        * [oxmysql](https://github.com/CommunityOx/oxmysql)
    * Use any supported framework: **OX**, **QBOX**, **ESX**, **QB**, or **Standalone**.
    
    ### Step 2: Download and Extract
    * Download & extract the `evolent_fleamarket` resource from [Cfx.re](https://forum.cfx.re/) and place it inside your `resources` folder.

    ### Step 3: Execute SQL Files
    * Execute all `.sql` files found in the `sql` folder into your server's database. This sets up the necessary tables for progression and contracts.

    ### Step 4: Configuration
    * Configure the `config.lua` to fit your server's needs (framework, categories, subcategories, etc.). Visit [Configuration](/fleamarket/Config) for a full breakdown.

    ### Step 6: Starting the Script
    * Add `evolent_fleamarket` to your server's resource list and start the script. **Ensure it is started AFTER all dependencies.**

    ```bash
    ensure ox_lib
    ensure oxmysql
    ensure evolent_fleamarket
    ```
