Tired of the same old point A to B boosts? Yeah, us too. That’s why we built a next-level boosting system.  
Our system is packed with variety, real progression, and features that actually make sense.

## Installation

<Steps>
    ### Step 1: Install Dependencies
    * Ensure you have the following **required resources** installed:
        * Any of the inventory scripts defined in [Configuration](/boosting/Config)
        * [ox_lib](https://github.com/CommunityOx/ox_lib)
        * [oxmysql](https://github.com/CommunityOx/oxmysql)
        * [ox_target](https://github.com/CommunityOx/ox_target)
        * [bl_ui](https://github.com/Byte-Labs-Studio/bl_ui) (Replaceable with other mini-games)
    * Use any supported framework: **OX**, **QBOX**, **ESX**, **QB**, or **Standalone**.
    
    ### Step 2: Download and Extract
    * Download & extract the `evolent_boosting` resource from [Cfx.re](https://forum.cfx.re/) and place it inside your `resources` folder.

    ### Step 3: Execute SQL Files
    * Execute all `.sql` files found in the `sql` folder into your server's database. This sets up the necessary tables for progression and contracts.

    ### Step 4: Add Items to ox_inventory
    * Add the following entries to your `ox_inventory/data/items.lua`. These items are used to access the hacking minigame and the boosting contract UI, respectively.

    ```lua
    ["ghostlink"] = {
        label = "GhostLink",
        weight = 5000,
        stack = true,
        close = true,
        client = {
            event = 'evolent_boosting:startHacking'
        }
    },
    -- add this only if you won't use cmd
    ["boostingtablet"] = {
        label = "Boosting Tablet",
        weight = 5000,
        stack = true,
        close = true,
        client = {
            export = 'evolent_boosting.openTablet'
        }
    },
    ```

    ### Step 5: Configuration
    * Configure the `config.lua` to fit your server's needs (framework, locations, rewards, etc.). Visit [Configuration](/boosting/Config) for a full breakdown.

    ### Step 6: Starting the Script
    * Add `evolent_boosting` to your server's resource list and start the script. **Ensure it is started AFTER all dependencies.**

    ```bash
    ensure ox_lib
    ensure oxmysql
    ensure evolent_boosting
    ```
